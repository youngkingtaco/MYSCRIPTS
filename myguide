throughout my experience as a SysAdmin, i have been working with bash scripts for quite a long time. 
I have decided to share some helpful steps that has helped me to develop my scripts. 
To be honest, when i started my career, i have struggled with bash, so i felt like by sharing these steps
I could help anyone to develop a good script. ENJOY !!!!!

1. shebang or !#/bin/bash
2. always comments every step that you are doing for any confusion
3. Generate variables
4. Create Functions for your script - local variables 
5.  develop the main script content
6. exit with an exit status ### you dont necessarily have to do it a lot
